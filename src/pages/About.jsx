        <p>
          My name is Matthew Bedsun, and I’ve been building, supporting, and securing IT environments professionally for over 14 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey started at just eight years old, when I built my first PC to squeeze better performance out of the games I loved. That childhood passion grew into a career—beginning at Best Buy, where I quickly moved into Geek Squad, helping everyday consumers with their devices and networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, I advanced into enterprise infrastructure, working as a Data Center Operations Engineer and later transitioning into system administration. Today, I serve as a traveling Systems Engineer, designing, deploying, and supporting secure IT environments across industries.

        <p>
          Whether it’s setting up a home office, recovering data from a failed drive, or architecting an Azure Virtual Desktop deployment for an enterprise, I bring the same level of precision, trust, and dedication to every project—no matter the scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          From neighborhood tech fixes to multi-site infrastructure rollouts, I meet clients where they are—and help get them where they need to be.
